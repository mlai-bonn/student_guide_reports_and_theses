\title{Student Guide for Reports, Theses and Presentations at MLAI}

\begin{document}


\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This documents collects some guidelines for writing theses, seminar reports, and lab reports and giving accompanying presentations within the MLAI group at the University of Bonn.
	Generally, you should ensure that
	the reader always has to know what a section (subsection, paragraph) is about and how it is relevant to the overall context (\textbf{red thread}), that you explain everything in a way such that a colleague of yours would understand it (\textbf{target audience}), that you define everything properly and uniquely and do not contradict yourself (\textbf{inner logic}), that you correctly reference everything that is not your own work (\textbf{no plagiarism}), and that you motivate and explain all choices you made and point out strengths and flaws of your own work (\textbf{critical self-reflection}).

\end{abstract}

\section{Initial Remarks}
Writing is a skill that needs to be refined over time. We hope this document will give you a head start, not only by providing best practice advice, but by directing your attention to certain things that will enable you to better reflect on the quality of your document.

\paragraph{Disclaimer} This document is meant as a guide to give you an idea of our expectations regarding written presentation of your results. It can not and does not constitute an exhaustive list of our formal requirements. Thus this document does not provide a base for arguments over grades.

\subsection{Conventions Throughout this Document}
This document collects hints and best practices for scientific writing in general and the various text formats that students have to hand in at our group in particular.
Whenever it is necessary to specify different parameters for different text types, we use the following acronyms:
\begin{description}
\item[BA] Bachelor's thesis
\item[MA] Master's thesis
\item[PG] Projektgruppenbericht
\item[SR] Seminar report
\item[LR] Lab report
\end{description}

\section{Scientific writing in general}
This section contains best practices, tips and tricks on good formal, scientific writing. Presenting your work in an accessible way is as much part of the scientific process as developing methods and conducting experiments. A well structured text reflects sound methodical thinking and makes it easier for the reader to concentrate on the content of your work. \cite{zobel_writing}

% \example{a}{b}
\

\subsection{Language}
\begin{itemize}

	\item Style
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use present tense (exception: Related Work and parts of Conclusion)
		\item No contractions:
		\begin{center}
			\eg{don't}{do not}\\
			\eg{hasn't}{has not }
		\end{center}
		\item Use active voice \\\eg{the experiments were conducted by X}{X conducted the experiments}
		\item \eg{Sentences spanning multiple lines, especially those that contain many neseted sentences, multiple arguments, many examples and enummerations should be avoided as to not unnecessarily fatigue the reader such that concentrating on the content is as easy at the end of the document as it was in the beginning.}{Avoid sentences that span multiple lines. Convoluted sentence construction is especially tiresome in longer documents.}\\ It is okay to write long sentences initially just to have all your thoughts collected in the document. When subsequently improving this first draft, break down those long sentences into shorter ones so the reader does not get lost.
		\item Choose between British and American English and stay consistent within it.
		\item Use spell checkers
	\end{itemize}
	\item Instead of "I" use "We", as in you, the author, walks the reader through your thinking process.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Formalia}
\begin{itemize}

	\item The document has to be a \textbf{PDF}.

	\item Length
	\begin{itemize}
		\item PG, SR, LR: 8-10 pages per person required
		\item BA: required are 25-50 pages (we recommend 40)
		\item MA: required are 25-100 pages (we recommend 50)
		\item the pagecount starts with the Introduction (first chapter) and ends with the Conclusion (last chapter). 
		\item The Bibliography is not part of the page count and you can have as many References as you like, without cutting into your page budget. 
	\end{itemize}

	\item Citations
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Citations style \textbf{either (Author, year) or [num]}. We recommend the first but chose what fits your style of writing best as long as you stay consistent and don't mix both citation styles.
		\item Citations are placed at the \textbf{end} of the sentence, before the dot ("silent" reference). 

		\eg{... by now is a well established fact. [42]}{... by now is a well established fact [42].}
		\eg{... by now is a well established fact. (Adams, 1979)}{... by now is a well established fact (Adams, 1979).}
		\item Exception are ``loud references'', that is if the sentence is broken without using the reference explicitly: "Horv\'ath et al. (2020) have shown \dots".
		Note that (Author, Year) citations differ in this case:

		\eg{(Welke, 2020) uses references incorrectly.}{Welke (2021) shows that people can learn from past mistakes}. 

		(Note the different placement of brackets)
		\item You need to mark \textbf{everything} with a reference that is not part of the current contribution or the current result (i.e. your own work) of this particular document. In particular, referencing your own older work (e.g., a seminar report from last semester) requires a citation. This can include figures (also recreated ones), tables, algorithms, lemmata, results, arguments etc.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Bibliography \label{general_bib}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Not all types of sources (web pages, proceedings, books) come with the same set of meta data (author, year, edition, date of access, link, chapter, pages) neither is necessarily all the information relevant. Present the information that is necessary for the reader to find the cited source (and perhaps the relevant section) but avoid overloading the entries with redundant or unnecessary information.
		\item Scientific context/ related work: journal article $>$ conference $>$ workshop paper
		\item Basics: textbooks
		\item Misc: web pages
		\item Datasets: Most are associated with a scientific publication. If they are distributed via a website this is also the place where you can usually find information on how to cite them properly.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Different \LaTeX-packages are available to handle citations and references. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \verb+natbib+ allows (Author, Year), as well as [num] styles. It has dedicated commands \verb+\citep{}+ for ``silent'' and \verb+\citet{}+ for ``loud'' citations.
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Notation and conventions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Adhere to field specific conventions regarding vocabulary and technical terms, variables and acronyms.
	\item Avoid using ambiguous words (normal, canonical \dots) except when properly introduced beforehand
	\item Definitions should be as formal as possible, a prose explanation of something is good style but only complementary.
	\item Different sources can use the same variable with different meanings. When citing you can adapt those definitions as to avoid ambiguous use for the variables within your document. Stay \textbf{consistent} within your document!
	\item See Section~\ref{sec:helpful-resources}, esp. \cite[pp. 1-8]{knuth_mathematical_writing}
\end{itemize}

\section{Visual Presentation}

In addition to a well structured content a tidy and consistent visual presentation greatly benefits readability. We highly suggest you use \LaTeX.

\subsection{Text}
\begin{itemize}
	\item No headline after a headline
	\item Use a readable font
	\item Font size: 10--12pt
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Text elements}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \LaTeX: \textbf{Floats} \footnote{\href{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions}{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,\_Figures\_and\_Captions}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\exists \Rightarrow$ use them
		\item Floats wrap around nearly everything that is non-text. They enumerate themselves automatically, can be referenced by name set in $\backslash$label\{\dots\} via $\backslash $ref\{\dots\} and provide a place for a $\backslash$caption\{\dots\}
		\item Each float needs to be referenced and explained in the text
		\item Each float has a caption that gives a standalone explanation
		\item Place floats close to where they are referenced to in the text
	\end{itemize}
	\item Each axis on each plots needs to be labeled
	\item When citing a table from another document, do not use a screen shot bitmap, but instead rebuild the table 
	\item Never use image files such as .png / .jpeg when avoidable. Use \textbf{vector graphics}!
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure of a thesis} \label{sec:structure}

Most theses (and articles, for that matter), are similarly structured. 
A similar structure helps your more seasoned readers (think: examiners) to focus on the content (i.e., what you did). 
It is good to adhere to the standard, everything that distracts the reader from the content that you want to present should be avoided.

Your content and results should be creative, not your layout.
We provide a \LaTeX-template for theses and reports on our homepage.
You may use it as you see fit and change it according to your liking for your thesis.

\section{A Possible Timeline for your Thesis}

It is your task to structure your own work. 
Part of writing a thesis is showing us that you are able to work independently on a scientific topic. 
Hence, we will not force you to do anything or to adhere to any structure that we might feel suitable for a thesis. 
However, Figure~\ref{fig:thesistimeline} provides a generic timeline for your thesis that you might consider as a starting point for your own time table.


% \section{Supervision}

% When writing a thesis or a report, you will have a supervisor who is a member of our group.



\begin{sidewaysfigure}

  \resizebox{\textheight}{!}{
    \input{timeline/thesis_timeline}
  }

  \caption{A possible timeline of your thesis.}
  \label{fig:thesistimeline}
\end{sidewaysfigure}


\section{Thesis Proposal / Thesis Expos\'{e}}

Before you formally register your thesis at the examination office we expect you to have a written expos\'{e} ready.
This piece of writing has to be agreed upon by yourself and your supervisor.
You can see it as an agreement on the scope of your thesis. 
It should be 1--3 pages and contain 
\begin{itemize}
\item your detailed research question(s),
\item an initial (brief) review of relevant related work,
\item a short overview of methods and experiments that you want to apply to answer your question(s), and
\item an outline of the structure of your thesis.
\end{itemize} 
Your expos\'{e} can ideally serve as the basis of your actual thesis.



\section{Helpful Resources} \label{sec:helpful-resources}

\section{Talks and Presentations}

As important as written communication is in science, it is not the only means by which you have to be able to present your work. Giving talks and presentations is equally important. As with writing, talking about your work (or any other topic) is a skill that can be trained and refined over time.

Some people like to put lots of pictures on their slides, some like their slides slim and clean; some people like constant interaction with the audience, some people prefer to have a long discussion after the talk instead, others do both. We want to encourage you to experiment with your presentation style. Try to find out what suits you best, what you feel comfortable with and how you can make the presentation fun, not only for your audience but also for yourself. However, despite all the creative freedom presentations offer, there are some things that can make or break a presentation and this is what we want to address in this section. 

% allgemein Benotung; wie, was, Zeitlimit
Disclaimer: Before really getting into this section we need to stress the one formal requirement for presentations at the university: When grading your talk we need to take into account whether or not you managed to \textbf{stay within the time limit}. 
% maybe a bit too harsh, but that's something I've been told early on that I can't forget 

\subsection{Structure}

On a fundamental level a good presentation and a well written text are very similar -- after all both have the goal to convey certain information to an audience. This means when developing a presentation one again needs to pay close attention to the overall structure, inner logic and the target audience.

% Struktur
A very general outline for a presentation in the Labs/ PGs/ theses would be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Title - topic, name(s), date
    % I'd argue this is the introduction and should come before any knowledge-slides
    \item Motivation of the Problem
    \item Background knowledge necessary to understand the talk
    \item Your work
    \item Summary \& Future Work
    % \item start with an illustrative example/ story/ anecdote
    % \item stick to your red thread
\end{itemize}

To attract the attention of your audience, introduce your topic with an illustrative example, a story or an anecdote.
It can serve as a point of reference throughout the whole presentation that you can connect back to.
Further, we recommend to add transition slides between main parts of the presentation, signaling the shift to a new topic. They serve as a break for you and the audience. 
Keep in mind your time limit when planning the structure of your presentation. If you cannot estimate how long you will need for your presentation, practice it beforehand. Do not forget to account for time for audience questions in your time budget. Exceeding your time limit can be seen as an insult, showing that you value your time more than your audience's time.

\subsection{Slides and Presentation Style}

We can see that the proposed outline is indeed very similar to how a report or thesis is structured but the formal presentation differs greatly. 

Depending on the target audience, context of the talk and time constraints, one may have to make trade-offs between all of those points. Most of the time the bigger picture is more important than finer details. A very simple, but helpful guiding question is: What is the most important thing that you want the audience to remember from your talk?

It is also beneficial to think about: Why do you give this presentation? Why is the audience attending the presentation? (The trivial answer "We have to give/ attend the presentation" is of course correct, but misses the point here). % I noticed we only use the word "trivial" only once in the whole guide so far, which is obviously unacceptable

While there is no right or wrong for how your slides should look, there are of course some best practices we recommend:
% Some very general best practices for the slides:

% Slides
\begin{itemize}
    \item do not put entire sentences on the slides, note down keywords
    \item take your time to explain your math (at least conceptually)
    \item use illustrative images to underline your messages
    \item graphs: explain units, axes, methodology and take away messages
    \item illustrate short algorithms with pseudocode, longer algorithms with examples/ animations
    % up for debate:
    \item achieve clear arrangements by using white space
\end{itemize}

% Presentation (style)
Also: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item check your tools and technologies in advance
    \item speak rather too slow than too fast
    \item keep eye contact with your audience
    \item do not simply read the contents of your slides
    \item clearly establish the rules for your talk in the beginning (e.g. is it okay to interrupt you at any point or just ask questions later?)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{More abstract}

To not limit your creativity with more guidelines, we want to instead prompt you with questions that \textit{the audience} of a talk should be able to answer positively:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Big Picture
% # The Big Picture
% ## Does the presentation follow a clear outline? Did you feel lost at any point?
% ## Do the audio and video channels complement each other?
% ## Do you feel like you have an idea what the central question of the thesis is about?
% ## What is your overall impression of the talk?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Does the presentation follow a clear outline? Did you feel lost at any point?
            \item Do the acoustic and visual channels complement each other?
            \item Do you feel like you have an idea what the central question of the thesis is about?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Visual Channel
% # Video Channel
% ## What do you like about the slides?
% ## How could the slides be improved?
% ## Do you notice anything about the body language of the presenter?
% ## Further remarks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Did each slide have a clear focal point?
            \item Do you notice anything about the body language of the presenter?
        \end{itemize}
    \item Acoustic Channel
% # Audio Channel
% ## What do you like about the oral presentation?
% ## What could be improved?
% ## Is the speed of the speech appropriate and is the pronunciation clear?
% ## Does the presenter explain the content in an accessible and simple way?
% ## Further remarks
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Is the speed of the speech appropriate and is the pronunciation clear (enough)?
            \item Does the presenter explain the content in an accessible and simple way?
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Since it is hard to give illustrative examples of good talks within a text document, what better place to watch and learn more about giving a great presentation than a talk series on giving a great presentation \autocite{tedTEDTalksFull}. We also recommend to go to your preferred streaming platform, look for a presentation on a topic of choice and try to analyze it with the questions above in mind.
